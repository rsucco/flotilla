# Flotilla
Turn-based naval strategy game inspired by Battleship and XCOM. This is still very much a work in progress, and might end up proving overly ambitious, but I'm mostly doing this project as a way to get more familiar with Godot.

Basic gameplay is similar to Battleship, with some exceptions:
- Rather than a 10x10 rectangular grid, each player places their ships on a 15x15 hexagonal grid. Ships can be placed diagonally.
- Rather than starting with one of each ship, each player is alloted a certain amount of points to purchase ships, and can choose their own fleet composition.
- Some tiles are island tiles where ships are not allowed to go. Coastal batteries can be placed on these tiles.
- Every ship is allowed to fire at least once per turn.
- Every ship is allowed to move at least one tile or rotate at least 60Â° per turn.
- Most ships have a special ability that can be used after a cooldown period.
- Most ships have a passive ability that improves their effectiveness.
- Some ships have drawbacks that reduce their effectiveness under specific conditions.
