# Flotilla
Turn-based naval strategy game inspired by Battleship and XCOM and written in Godot

Basic gameplay is similar to Battleship, with some exceptions:
- Rather than a 10x10 rectangular grid, each player places their ships on a 15x15 hexagonal grid. Ships can be placed diagonally.
- Rather than starting with one of each ship, each player is alloted a certain amount of points to purchase ships, and can choose their own fleet composition.
- Some tiles are island tiles where ships are not allowed to go. Coastal batteries can be placed on these tiles.
- Every ship is allowed to fire at least once per turn.
- Every ship is allowed to move at least one tile or rotate at least 60Â° per turn, unless more than 50% damaged.
- Most ships have a special ability that can be used after a cooldown period.
- Most ships have a passive ability that improves their effectiveness.
- Some ships have a second special ability to really mix things up.
- Some ships have drawbacks that reduce their effectiveness under specific conditions.

### Release History
##### 0.1.1 (25SEP2023):
After taking a break for a while, I've been having fun coming back to this project. All the special/passive abilities are implemented and animated, and I'm pretty happy with how the game is looking so far. Next big step is to add audio and UI for actually starting/finishing a game, at which point hotseat multiplayer will be fully playable.

##### 0.1.0 (10DEC2022):
After a couple years of off-and-on planning, a couple months of trying to learn Godot, and a couple weeks of actual coding, the core game loop and the skeleton of the game are complete, and it's playable at the most basic level. Ship placement works and ships can move and fire, but I haven't yet implemented special abilities and most of the passive abilities/drawbacks. Graphical presentation is also pretty rough at this point, and there's no sound. I estimate that I'm at the point where I've done the 20% of the work that accounts for 80% of the completed game though, which is encouraging. Going forward, I plan to focus on graphics, polish, and information presentation to the players. Once the game is suitably polished I'll consider that an 0.2.0 release, then move forward with adding an AI player, then on to adding network multiplayer.
